# Type Safety Cautions

## 1. Types Are Not Enforced at Runtime

<Callout type='info'>
  This is not a bug, but rather a feature.
</Callout>

### The Scope

This affects everything in **thread**.

### Why Not?

Although **thread** is intended to be used with strict type checking,
we want to follow Python's design of **"optional types"**.
This allows **thread** to be compatible with different projects which may follow different architectural conventions.

### What Does This Mean?

In other words, types are only enforced at the LSP/Linting level.

This means that you can annotate your code with types and still run it with while passing the wrong types.
Your LSP/Linter will detect the type error and scream at you, **thread** will not validate types at runtime.

### Simple example

Consider the following code;

`threaded_function` takes 1 integer as it's first argument and returns an integer.
The parsed argument, `"a"`, is not an integer. Thread **will not** raise a type error, however,
a type error will be raised at runtime due to the invalid opperand between a string and an integer.


## 2. Args and Kwargs do not provide static type checking

<Callout type='warning'>
  This is unfortunately due to Python&gt;s typing library
</Callout>

### The Scope

This only affects **args** and **kwargs** in `thread.Thread()` initialization.

```py
import thread

def draw(x: int, y: int) -> bool: ...
worker = thread.Thread(target=draw, args=(thread,), kwargs={'y': ':<'}) # This will not be underlined by your LSP/linter

# Other methods from Thread are not affected
worker.result # Will be typed as bool
```

### Why is this so?

`thread.Thread()` uses Python's typing library's `ParamSpec` to determine the arguments types of the `target` function.
Due to ParamSpec.args and ParamSpec.kwargs requirement to be used as argument overloads, we cannot assign it to the `args` and `kwargs` arguments of `thread.Thread()`.

```py
P = ParamSpec('P')
T = TypeVar('T')

# What is required by ParamSpec.args and ParamSpec.kwargs
def __init__(
  self,
  target: Callable[P, T],
  *args: P.args,
  **kwargs: P.kwargs
) -> None: ...

# What we need
def __init__(
  self,
  target: Callable[P, T],
  args: P.args,
  kwargs: P.kwargs,
  *threadingArgs,
  **threadKwargs
) -> None: ...
```

### Is this fixable?

Yes, if we change how we write `thread.Thread()`'s initialization.
However, we want to make migrating to **thread** easy from the default threading library, and thus we will not change this for now and focus on adding new features.
